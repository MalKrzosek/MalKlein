    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>For my website project I decided to design my own portfolio web page. For the coursework purposes, it is focused on 3D Modelling and Animation of the three models. </p>


<section id="models" class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 mb-4">

          <p>Watch it grow and bloom!</p>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


    <p>In the future, I would like to expand it with my other work, so I have provided a space for it under the Projects section, with dropdown categories: 3D Modelling & Animation, 3D Game Design, Video Production, and Live Broadcast.</p>
    <p>This website represents my individual style. It’s a place to store my work and showcase my development as a designer.</p>
 

    <p>I was strongly influenced with my design choices by these two websites:  <li><a href="https://thisistommy.com/">This is tommy</a>: an independent creative agency and digital studio.
      and <a href="https://isamaya.co.uk">ISAMAYA</a>: "...it’s about celebrating what's uniquely you..." </p>


      <br>
    <h3>My website features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.html">Landing page</a></li>
      <li><a href="coke.html">Diet Coke page</a></li>
      <li><a href="dog.html">Balloon Dog page</a></li>
      <li><a href="plant.html">Flower page</a></li>
      <li><span style="color: grey;">About page - you are here now!</span></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
   
    <p>Primary font: Oxanium, a clean, futuristic sans-serif designed by Vernon Adams in 2017  (loaded via Google Fonts). </p>

    <p>Logo font: Etna Condensed Light, quirky serif, inspired by Aetna wood type designed by Mark Simonson in 2020 - (loaded locally from assets/fonts/etnaxcondensed-light.otf).</p>




    <br>
    <h3>Colour Palette</h3>

    <div class="about-image">
      <img src="assets/about/colorpalette.png" alt="Color palette" class="img-fluid">
      <p class="image-caption">Figure 1: Colour Palette I used for my website. </p>
    </div>



    <br>
<h3>Landing Page Elements</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p>A black strap at the top promotes my email address</p></li>
<li><p>Responsive Navbar developed using Bootstrap; it collapses into a burger menu on small screens. Developed following tutorials available on  Canvas. I complemented it with pink hover effect, inspired by Tommy’s website. The contact section icons were created using Bootstrap.</p></li>
<li><p>Hero section features a carousel made with Bootstrap. The three videos (my own projects) change in 5 seconds intervals. 
  1st video is a 3-minute recording of my P3D module game, 
  2nd an into to a live show designed for LVP module, 3rd video featuring dancing avatars is a passion project made outside of the course.
  </p></li>

<li><p>A Black and pink text section supporting personal style and website aesthetic. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Models section: Responsiveness and grid system was made with Bootstrap. Each model’s animation was created by rendering Blender PNG sequences, edited in After Effects, colour-corrected in Final Cut Pro, and compiled into MP4 files. Each model container acts as a button linking to separate HTML pages. To make it more interactive, there’s a slight change to the scale and pink glow on hover.
</p></li>

<li><p>Footer: Displays my logo and hyperlinks to Instagram and YouTube.</p></li>

</ul>




<br>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>Each of the three Blender models has its own HTML page and shares a common ‘styles.css’ for visual consistency.</p>
<p>Navigation elements (home button and logos) link back to the landing page.</p>
<p>The model pages are minimalistic and clean, using the same white, pink, and black colour palette. Originally, each page had separate CSS, but based on feedback from course mates , I unified them to feel more cohesive.</p>


<ul>
<li><p>The 3D scene is centred inside a .scene div.</p></li>
<li><p>Three.js renders the models inside an HTML canvas.</p></li>

  <p>It took me a lot of time to figure out how to make it work. I started following the tutorials provided on Canvas but my models weren’t appearing. It took me another week, multiple versions of Java Script and help from my course mates to finally make it work!</p>
</ul>



<br>
<h3>Background Images</h3>

<p>To each model I added background images loaded via THREE.Texture loader. </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Diet Coke background is a sky image that I found online. I colour corrected it to match the sky from the thumbnail animation. </p></li>
  <li><p> Balloon Dog background is the 3D scene I made for the thumbnail animation. </p></li>
  <li><p>The Flower model background is an image that I found online and expanded it using AI generative expand in Photoshop. </p></li>
</ul>




<br>
<h3>Lightning</h3>
<p>I attempted HDR environment lighting to simulate reflections. Unfortunately every time I tried to load .hdr image using RGBELoader and assign it to the scene, I was failing so I eventually resigned and ended up using Hemisphere, Directional, and Ambient lights with ACESFilmicToneMapping. I still was not happy how my model materials look so I tweaked them to give them some highlights and shiny look using Metalness, Roughness and Environment map intensity. </p>
<br>
<p>After some final improvements, I tweaked the lightning of the Diet Coke model. I used a white light to simulate the sun and added a light with pink hue. I was trying to make it look like a sunset.  </p>


<br>
<h3>Interactivity</h3>
<p>Users can orbit around every model using mouse controls.</p>
<p>Each model page has three buttons: two to trigger specific animations, and one to toggle wireframe mode.</p>
<p>I have the animations to only play once when triggered. One model is hidden and and the other is shown. </p>
<p>Below the canvas there is a ‘Play next’ section  which helps navigate between models.It invites users to stay on my website and keep exploring.</p>
<p>I Integrated audio to complement the animations. I found the relevant sounds on  https://freesound.org/. Audio is triggered through buttons and plays immediately to match the animations.</p>




<br>
<h3>3D models</h3>

<p>The first model that I made was a Diet Coke Can. I created it following the tutorial on Canvas. It looked simple at first, but as I started working on it, I realised that a ‘simple’ can has much more details than I initially thought. I really enjoy working in Blender, and since I hadn’t used some of the modelling techniques covered in this process before, I spent a lot of time perfecting the details. </p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/ringpull.png" alt="Diet Coke ring pull" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 2: Close-up view of the Diet Coke can ring pull. </p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I couldn’t find the right label on the internet, so I created my own.</p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/dietcokelabel.jpg" alt="Diet Coke Label" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 3: Diet Coke can Label</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>I created an animation where the can is opened and can being crushed as a separate model. For the thumbnail, I seamlessly looped the can opening animation, and set it in a fully lit scene with subtly moving clouds.</p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/cokewithclouds.jpg" alt="Diet Coke Label" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 4: Diet Coke can model</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>The second model I made was the Ballon dog. Since I spent three weeks working on the Diet Coke Can, I needed something with fever details that I could model quickly, while still providing strong visuals for animation. </p>
<p>I created an animation where the dog sits, and a separate model where it lays down. For the thumbnail, I seamlessly looped the sitting animation, and built a scene featuring a lawn, a dog house, and a ball.</p>
<ul><li><p>Fun fact: The animation took 102 hours to render!</p></li></ul>



<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/dog.png" alt="Diet Coke Label" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 5: Baloon Dog</p>
</div>

<br>
<p>My third model is a futuristic-looking flower. I first modelled a single petal, then multiplied it to create the flowers.
  <div class="about-image">
    <img src="assets/about/flowercloseup.png" alt="Flower Closeup" class="img-fluid">
    <p class="image-caption">Figure 6: Blooming flower model close-up.</p>
  </div>
  
  <br>
  I animated it growing from a pot with a separate model that shows it blooming. The thumbnail animation features surreal landscape with rocks and dark, foggy sky. It is subtly animated to give the immersive effect of the model breathing.</p>

  <p class="image-caption">Figure 7: Last Frame of my 'Blooming Flower' animation.</p>
</div>



<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>I exported all my models as glb files. When I first checked how they look in glTF Viewer, they didn’t look right. 
  The animations weren’t playing in sync, some of the elements appeared distorted or disconnected from the models. My flower model had missing textures. </p>
<p>-It took me another week to analyse what is wrong with the export. </p>
<p>I found out that all animations have to be Grouped by NLA Tracks. 
  I had to open the NLA Editor and assign ‘New Action’ to every animated element. I also had to make sure that the animation of every element has the same duration so they play in sync. </p>


  <h3>Challenges: Baloon Dog</h3>
<p>I was modelling my objects using modifiers so in order for them to be visible in .glb export, I had to make sure they are applied. This unfortunately caused some reposition to my ballon dog model -its legs shifted to one side.- I had to position the elements again. </p>

<p>Because of the initial export challenges, my transitions between ‘Dog Sitting’ model and ‘Dog Laying Down' are not seamless. As I was repositioning the elements in separate models which made them different.I was planning to change it as it definitely would improve the quality of user experience - the shift during transition between models is very visible- but I had to move over to other elements of my project. </p>
<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/dogsdiffrence.png" alt="Balloon Dog positions" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 8: Side to side comparison of the ending position of model 1 and starting position of model 2.</p>
</div>

<br>
<p>While making some improvements, I tried to reposition the legs for better transition. The diffrence is still noticable, but it looks better than before. I also changed the colours of the models to better match with the thumbnail animation.  </p>

<br>

<h3>Challenges: Flower</h3>
<p>The solution for missing textures in the Flower model was swapping them for less complicated ones. -Again I had to do it separately for the two models so the textures are not seamlessly matching between them which ruins the transition. As I was not expecting to face so many issues, which caused a delay in my planned working schedule I decided to leave it as it is and move over. 
</p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/flower3.png" alt="Flower Materials" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 9: Side to side comparison of materials used for model 1 and model 2.</p>
</div>
<p>After all, I managed to change the mismatching textures to create seamless transition!</p>

<br>
<h3>Challenges: Diet Coke</h3>
<p>After fixing the initial animation issues with Diet Coke model, I was hoping for seamless transition on my website…Yet another problem appeared! While it looked great in different .glb viewers, after linking to my website through Java Script, my model appears with missing textures. I was trying various tutorials to fix it but I couldn’t find the issue.</p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/jseditor.png" alt="Diet Coke model comparison" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 10: Diet Coke can model in threejs editor, glTF Viever and loaded on my website. </p>
</div>
<br>
<p> While making some final improvements, I decided to try one more time make it look better. I still couldn’t find the issue why the textures were not displaying. The idea was to import the .glb model to blender and try to 'wrap' the label again. After uploading it to my coke.js and checking if it works. </p>
<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/coke2.png" alt="Label test" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 11: Diet Coke label test. </p>
</div>
  
  <p>I added cylinder, deleted the caps, resized it to the size of my can. Then I moved to the shading tab and created new material. I added texture node, mapping and texture coordinates. I added my label. I then repositioned it using UV editing. I then entered editing mode and using loopcut and resizing tool tried to match the can shape. I finnished it off by applying the shrink wrap modifier and shading it smooth. It ended up not looking as great as the original model, but it was still a huge improvement from what I previously had. I found out that my can looked so dark because it was very metallic. So to override my GLB model texture settings, I updated the metalness and roughness in the code. This helped to reveal more color and balanced the overall look. I then changed the lightning setup to simulate sunset and add some warmth. I added warm fillight, rimlight, bottom light and soft ambient light. </p>
<p>unfortunately, my idea with adding the label on cylinder didn't really work for my crush animation.</p>

<div class="about-image">
  <img src="assets/about/cokecylinder.png" alt="Diet Coke model with reapplied label on cylinder, crush animation" class="img-fluid">
  <p class="image-caption">Figure 12: Diet Coke model with reapplied label on cylinder, crush animation. </p>
</div>


<br>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I manually went through every element to check if everything is linked correctly. I checked all buttons to make sure they work. All animations, sounds, interactive elements and pages work as expected, apart from a few known issues. 
</p>
<p>I tested the site across different screen sizes and confirmed they work properly. I made sure that my contact details are accurate.</p>
<p>I did some user testing with my friends. I asked them how they feel about the navigation, interaction with models, sounds and colours. 
  I applied some of the feedback and moved away from various pastel colours of my model pages and consistently applied the same colour palette across the entire site. 
  </p>




<br>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>This project taught me a lot about 3D workflows and web development. I had to solve problems and make impactful decisions under pressure of time. <br>I am aware of the imperfections , yet I’m pleased with the outcome, the progress I made and the skills I gained.</p>
<p>For the submission, I have zipped my full project folder and provided all Blender model files.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)</p>
